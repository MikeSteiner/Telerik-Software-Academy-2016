 Description

 The earth is not flat. You are given a sequence of numbers representing heights. A peak is a height, that is larger than its direct neighbours and has exactly two of them. A valley is a sequence of 3 or more heights between two peaks, including the peaks.

 A pocket is a valley that:

 Has immediate neighbours (N1 and N2)) which are peaks


 Pockets are in green
 Your task is to write a program which finds the sum of all pockets in a valley.

 Input

 Input will consist of an array with single element: the heights with a space between them
 The input will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to validate it explicitly.
 Output

 Output should consist of a single line: the sum of all pockets
 Constraints

 The number of heights will always be less than 10000
 Each height will be between 0 and 50
 Time limit: 0.3 s
 Memory limit: 16 MB
 Solution template

 Follow the exact template:
 function solve(args){
 let heights = args[0]...

 let result;

 //your solution here

 console.log(result);
 }
